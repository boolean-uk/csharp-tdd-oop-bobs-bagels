1. As a member of the public,
So I can order a bagel before work,
I'd like to add a specific type of bagel to my basket.

2. As a member of the public,
So I can change my order,
I'd like to remove a bagel from my basket.

3. As a member of the public,
So that I can not overfill my small bagel basket
I'd like to know when my basket is full when I try adding an item beyond my basket capacity.

4. As a Bob's Bagels manager,
So that I can expand my business,
I’d like to change the capacity of baskets.

5. As a member of the public
So that I can maintain my sanity
I'd like to know if I try to remove an item that doesn't exist in my basket.

6. As a customer,
So I know how much money I need,
I'd like to know the total cost of items in my basket.

7. As a customer,
So I know what the damage will be,
I'd like to know the cost of a bagel before I add it to my basket.

8. As a customer,
So I can shake things up a bit,
I'd like to be able to choose fillings for my bagel.

9. As a customer,
So I don't over-spend,
I'd like to know the cost of each filling before I add it to my bagel order.

10. As the manager,
So we don't get any weird requests,
I want customers to only be able to order things that we stock in our inventory.
